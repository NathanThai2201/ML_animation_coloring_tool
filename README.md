*** ML Animation Coloring Tool ***


A Machine Learning approach to automatically coloring 2d animation cells.
Features are extracted from contours of closed regions within animation cells, 
labels are given by a palette of colors.

Features and Labels are trained on with random forest classifier.

New frames are reconstructed with the model, color prediction accuracy at 90%
