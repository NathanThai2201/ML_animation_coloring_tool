# ML Animation Coloring Tool 


## Overview
> **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. Transforms**<br>
A Machine Learning approach to automatically coloring 2d animation cells.<br>
Features are extracted from contours of closed regions within animation cells, <br>
labels are given by a palette of colors.<br>
 <br> 
Features and Labels are trained on with random forest classifier.<br>
 <br>
New frames are reconstructed with the model, color prediction accuracy at 90%<br>
